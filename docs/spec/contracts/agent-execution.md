# Agent Execution Contract

> **Normative authority:** `requirements/execution.md`, especially `REQ-EXEC-136`, `REQ-EXEC-167` through `REQ-EXEC-184`, and `REQ-EXEC-201` through `REQ-EXEC-219`.
>
> This contract is loaded for every implementation and review context. It is intentionally concise; referenced requirement IDs contain the complete normative detail.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Implement only from a **READY** Phase Packet. Do not infer a phase from the compiled specification.
2. Do not reduce, postpone, stub, fake, or reinterpret scope because it is difficult.
3. If a requirement is impossible, contradictory, or unsafe, use the deviation protocol in `REQ-EXEC-168`; do not silently change it.
4. UI code must not mutate authoritative project state outside the typed command/domain boundary.
5. Do not create god objects, catch-all managers, giant stores, universal event buses, hidden global state, or speculative generic frameworks.
6. Do not use YAGNI, DRY, KISS, SOLID, or named patterns as slogans. Apply them only when they preserve documented capability and cohesion.
7. A production `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, placeholder, dummy implementation, `Not implemented` branch, or silent fallback is a gate failure unless explicitly authorised by the current Phase Packet.
8. Do not weaken tests, update golden data without evidence, mock away the behaviour under test, or suppress failures.
9. Refactor touched architecture when necessary to preserve boundaries. Do not perform unrelated sweeping rewrites.
10. Significant architectural decisions require an ADR and adversarial review.
11. Work in isolated Git worktrees when agents run concurrently. Integrate using atomic commits and direct merge into `main`; do not assume a PR workflow.
12. The implementing agent cannot approve its own phase. Independent multi-lens and adversarial review is mandatory.
13. Reviewer findings are hypotheses until verified. Verified genuine findings must be remediated according to severity before PASS.
14. Every requirement claimed complete must have evidence and a verification mechanism.
15. Never rely on the full compiled specification being resident in context. Load the Phase Context Pack and retrieve extra requirements by ID as needed.

## Mandatory Context Load Order

1. This contract.
2. `architecture-invariants.md`.
3. Current `phases/phase-XX-*.md`.
4. Requirement blocks named in that Phase Packet.
5. Referenced ADRs.
6. Public contracts and handoff capsules from prerequisite phases.
7. Relevant implementation-ledger entry.

## Stop Conditions

The agent must stop the current implementation path and mark the phase `BLOCKED` when:

- a blocker/critical contradiction cannot be resolved from authoritative sources;
- an upstream public contract is missing or incompatible;
- data integrity would be put at risk;
- a mandatory requirement is technically impossible and no approved fallback exists;
- the Phase Packet itself fails specification linting.

Stopping a path is not permission to abandon the phase. Record the issue, evidence, and recommended resolution.
