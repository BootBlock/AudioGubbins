# Global Architecture Invariants

These invariants apply to every phase. Violations are gate failures unless an approved ADR/specification change explicitly supersedes the invariant.

## State and Domain

- `REQ-ARCH-004`: source media is immutable by default; editing is non-destructive and parametric.
- `REQ-EDIT-073`: meaningful project mutations go through the typed command/domain layer.
- `REQ-ARCH-153`: authoritative domain, persisted history, user preferences, workspace/view state, renderer state, audio runtime state, and background-job state have explicit owners and lifetimes.
- Domain truth has one authoritative home. UI, persistence, workers, and Godot integrations may adapt domain results but must not reimplement rules independently.

## Dependency Direction

- UI depends on application/domain contracts, never persistence internals.
- Domain packages do not import browser-specific adapters.
- Persistence schemas do not become the domain model.
- DSP/audio domains do not depend on React or visual renderer internals.
- Godot integration consumes stable interchange contracts and does not reach into unrelated web-editor internals.
- Cross-package access uses public typed APIs; importing private package internals is prohibited.
- Circular package dependencies are prohibited.

## Media and Processing

- `REQ-ARCH-157`: the core channel model is N-channel and layout-aware; stereo assumptions are local adaptations only.
- `REQ-ARCH-049` and `REQ-ARCH-081`: deterministic canonical processing is the target for final render paths.
- `REQ-ARCH-144`: processor latency is explicit and compensable.
- Heavy analysis, DSP, codecs, waveform generation, spectrogram generation, import/export, and batch work must not block the UI thread.
- Derived waveform/spectrogram/render data is disposable cache, never the sole authoritative project state.

## Local-First and Privacy

- Core editing and rendering remain local and offline-capable.
- No diagnostics, logs, project metadata, capability data, audio, or other user data is transmitted without explicit permission.
- No usage analytics.
- Future cloud/native-host/plugin capabilities remain optional and cannot become hidden core dependencies.

## Failure and Recovery

- Errors have explicit recoverability semantics; blanket catches and silent fallback are prohibited.
- Project mutations and persistence operations protect data integrity across crash, tab termination, quota failure, and partial I/O.
- External side effects are never falsely represented as undoable.

## Extensibility Without Speculation

- Preserve explicitly documented future multitrack, plugin, cloud, and native-host extension boundaries.
- Do not implement speculative user-facing future features before their owning phase.
- Extension points must be concrete and narrow, not universal frameworks.

## Cohesion

- Files approaching 300–400 logical lines and functions approaching 50–70 logical lines trigger cohesion review; thresholds are not automatic failures or code-golf targets.
- Large fan-in/fan-out, giant stores, deep inheritance, unrelated responsibilities, and repeated domain conditionals trigger architectural review.
