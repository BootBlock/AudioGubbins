# AudioGubbins Phase 10 Context Pack

> **Generated artefact. Do not edit.**
> This is the bounded context intended for a fresh implementation/review agent. Canonical source remains the modular specification.

# Global Agent Execution Contract

# Agent Execution Contract

> **Normative authority:** `requirements/execution.md`, especially `REQ-EXEC-136`, `REQ-EXEC-167` through `REQ-EXEC-184`, and `REQ-EXEC-201` through `REQ-EXEC-219`.
>
> This contract is loaded for every implementation and review context. It is intentionally concise; referenced requirement IDs contain the complete normative detail.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Implement only from a **READY** Phase Packet. Do not infer a phase from the compiled specification.
2. Do not reduce, postpone, stub, fake, or reinterpret scope because it is difficult.
3. If a requirement is impossible, contradictory, or unsafe, use the deviation protocol in `REQ-EXEC-168`; do not silently change it.
4. UI code must not mutate authoritative project state outside the typed command/domain boundary.
5. Do not create god objects, catch-all managers, giant stores, universal event buses, hidden global state, or speculative generic frameworks.
6. Do not use YAGNI, DRY, KISS, SOLID, or named patterns as slogans. Apply them only when they preserve documented capability and cohesion.
7. A production `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, placeholder, dummy implementation, `Not implemented` branch, or silent fallback is a gate failure unless explicitly authorised by the current Phase Packet.
8. Do not weaken tests, update golden data without evidence, mock away the behaviour under test, or suppress failures.
9. Refactor touched architecture when necessary to preserve boundaries. Do not perform unrelated sweeping rewrites.
10. Significant architectural decisions require an ADR and adversarial review.
11. Work in isolated Git worktrees when agents run concurrently. Integrate using atomic commits and direct merge into `main`; do not assume a PR workflow.
12. The implementing agent cannot approve its own phase. Independent multi-lens and adversarial review is mandatory.
13. Reviewer findings are hypotheses until verified. Verified genuine findings must be remediated according to severity before PASS.
14. Every requirement claimed complete must have evidence and a verification mechanism.
15. Never rely on the full compiled specification being resident in context. Load the Phase Context Pack and retrieve extra requirements by ID as needed.

## Mandatory Context Load Order

1. This contract.
2. `architecture-invariants.md`.
3. Current `phases/phase-XX-*.md`.
4. Requirement blocks named in that Phase Packet.
5. Referenced ADRs.
6. Public contracts and handoff capsules from prerequisite phases.
7. Relevant implementation-ledger entry.

## Stop Conditions

The agent must stop the current implementation path and mark the phase `BLOCKED` when:

- a blocker/critical contradiction cannot be resolved from authoritative sources;
- an upstream public contract is missing or incompatible;
- data integrity would be put at risk;
- a mandatory requirement is technically impossible and no approved fallback exists;
- the Phase Packet itself fails specification linting.

Stopping a path is not permission to abandon the phase. Record the issue, evidence, and recommended resolution.

# Global Architecture Invariants

# Global Architecture Invariants

These invariants apply to every phase. Violations are gate failures unless an approved ADR/specification change explicitly supersedes the invariant.

## State and Domain

- `REQ-ARCH-004`: source media is immutable by default; editing is non-destructive and parametric.
- `REQ-EDIT-073`: meaningful project mutations go through the typed command/domain layer.
- `REQ-ARCH-153`: authoritative domain, persisted history, user preferences, workspace/view state, renderer state, audio runtime state, and background-job state have explicit owners and lifetimes.
- Domain truth has one authoritative home. UI, persistence, workers, and Godot integrations may adapt domain results but must not reimplement rules independently.

## Dependency Direction

- UI depends on application/domain contracts, never persistence internals.
- Domain packages do not import browser-specific adapters.
- Persistence schemas do not become the domain model.
- DSP/audio domains do not depend on React or visual renderer internals.
- Godot integration consumes stable interchange contracts and does not reach into unrelated web-editor internals.
- Cross-package access uses public typed APIs; importing private package internals is prohibited.
- Circular package dependencies are prohibited.

## Media and Processing

- `REQ-ARCH-157`: the core channel model is N-channel and layout-aware; stereo assumptions are local adaptations only.
- `REQ-ARCH-049` and `REQ-ARCH-081`: deterministic canonical processing is the target for final render paths.
- `REQ-ARCH-144`: processor latency is explicit and compensable.
- Heavy analysis, DSP, codecs, waveform generation, spectrogram generation, import/export, and batch work must not block the UI thread.
- Derived waveform/spectrogram/render data is disposable cache, never the sole authoritative project state.

## Local-First and Privacy

- Core editing and rendering remain local and offline-capable.
- No diagnostics, logs, project metadata, capability data, audio, or other user data is transmitted without explicit permission.
- No usage analytics.
- Future cloud/native-host/plugin capabilities remain optional and cannot become hidden core dependencies.

## Failure and Recovery

- Errors have explicit recoverability semantics; blanket catches and silent fallback are prohibited.
- Project mutations and persistence operations protect data integrity across crash, tab termination, quota failure, and partial I/O.
- External side effects are never falsely represented as undoable.

## Extensibility Without Speculation

- Preserve explicitly documented future multitrack, plugin, cloud, and native-host extension boundaries.
- Do not implement speculative user-facing future features before their owning phase.
- Extension points must be concrete and narrow, not universal frameworks.

## Cohesion

- REQ-EXEC-136.7: "A **production** source file approaching roughly 300–400 logical lines should trigger a cohesion review", and "A function approaching roughly 50–70 logical lines should trigger a decomposition review". Thresholds are review triggers, not automatic failures or code-golf targets.
- Large fan-in/fan-out, giant stores, deep inheritance, unrelated responsibilities, and repeated domain conditionals trigger architectural review.

# Current Phase Packet

# Phase 10 — Game-Audio Tooling

## Status

`NOT_READY` — blocked by Phase(s) 05, 06, 09 reaching `PASS`.

## Objective

Implement AudioGubbins' distinctive game-audio authoring workflows: loop creation/validation, asset groups, guided preparation, game-context auditioning, persistent export policy, and scalable one-shot/region production.

## User-Visible Outcome

Users can turn long recordings or individual sounds into organised game-ready assets, validate seamless loops, preview game-like triggering/attenuation, and reuse coherent processing/export policy without requiring Godot.

## Hard Dependencies

- Phase 05 — Core Non-Destructive Editing
- Phase 06 — Effect Rack and Core DSP
- Phase 09 — Import, Export, and Codec System

## Owned Requirements

- `REQ-GAME-023` — Game-Audio Features (`CURRENT`)
- `REQ-GAME-075` — Guided Task Workflows (`CURRENT`)
- `REQ-GAME-120` — Asset Groups and Inherited Game-Audio Policy (`CURRENT`)
- `REQ-GAME-121` — Seamless Loop Analysis and Validation (`CURRENT`)
- `REQ-GAME-122` — Game-Context Preview Simulator (`CURRENT`)

## Referenced Global Execution Requirements

- `REQ-EXEC-136`
- `REQ-EXEC-167`
- `REQ-EXEC-170`
- `REQ-EXEC-171`
- `REQ-EXEC-172`
- `REQ-EXEC-173`
- `REQ-EXEC-174`

- `REQ-EXEC-183`
- `REQ-EXEC-184`
- `REQ-EXEC-204`
- `REQ-EXEC-215`
- `REQ-EXEC-216`

## In Scope

- [ ] Game-audio workspace/guided workflows
- [ ] Asset groups and inherited policy
- [ ] One-shot preparation
- [ ] Named regions and game naming templates
- [ ] Seamless loop editor/analyser/candidate suggestions
- [ ] Game-context preview simulator
- [ ] Game-oriented export policy/recipes
- [ ] Loudness matching and game presets
- [ ] Batch-ready domain hooks

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Godot editor/runtime addon implementation
- Advanced stochastic variation generation owned by Phase 13
- Full multitrack composition

## Owned Modules / Packages

- `packages/game-audio`
- `packages/loop-analysis`
- `packages/export-recipes game layer`
- `apps/web game-audio workspace`

## Cross-Package Dependency Rules

- Game-audio domain depends on generic editing/DSP/export contracts.
- It must not import Godot-specific runtime/editor types.

## Required Public Contracts

- GameAssetGroup
- InheritedPolicy
- LoopDefinition/LoopAnalysis
- GamePreviewScenario
- NamingTemplate
- GameExportProfile

## Data / Schema Changes

- Introduces game asset-group policy, loop-analysis results, naming templates, game-preview scenarios and game export profiles.

## Browser / Platform Considerations

- All authoring features remain local/browser-based; direct Godot filesystem integration is not required in this phase.

## Architectural Invariants

- Guided workflows create the same inspectable operations an expert could create manually.
- Inheritance is explicit and overridable; no hidden magic settings.
- Loop suggestions never silently replace user loop points.
- Game preview is audition tooling, not the authoritative game runtime.

## Internal Work Units

### WU-10.A — Asset groups/policy

- [ ] Implement hierarchical game asset groups and override resolution
- [ ] Implement naming and export defaults

### WU-10.B — Guided workflows

- [ ] Implement Prepare One-Shot, Create Seamless Loop, Normalise Game SFX and related task flows
- [ ] Ensure generated operations remain fully editable

### WU-10.C — Loop analysis

- [ ] Implement discontinuity/DC/phase/level/zero-crossing analysis
- [ ] Implement candidate loop point suggestions and repeated-cycle audition

### WU-10.D — Game preview

- [ ] Implement rapid triggering, variation hooks, pitch/gain/start-offset simulation, attenuation and concurrency simulation

## Failure and Recovery Behaviour

- Invalid inherited settings must identify the owning group/override.
- Loop analysis failure must not alter saved loop points.
- Batch/guided operations fail atomically or record per-item failure explicitly.

## Required Verification Commands / Suites

- `pnpm test --filter game-audio --filter loop-analysis`
- `pnpm test:loop-golden`
- `pnpm test:e2e:game-workflows`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Long recordings can be segmented/named/processed/export-configured as many regions without source duplication.
- [ ] Loop analyser identifies known discontinuity fixtures and suggested points are reproducible.
- [ ] Guided workflows produce ordinary edit/effect/export objects visible in Inspector/history.
- [ ] Asset-group inheritance/override resolution is deterministic and directly tested.
- [ ] Game preview can repeatedly trigger representative one-shot/loop scenarios without changing authoritative edits.

## Forbidden Shortcuts

- No stubs, placeholder behaviour, fake success paths, or silent scope deferral.
- No weakening or deleting tests/golden evidence to make the phase pass.
- No god object, catch-all manager/service, giant global store, or hidden mutable singleton.
- No UI bypass of typed command/domain ownership.
- No undocumented dependency or public-contract change.
- No hidden beginner-only data model.
- No Godot-specific types in core game-audio domain.
- No automatic loop-point mutation without explicit user action.

## Required Review Lenses

- Audio / DSP Correctness
- UX / Accessibility
- Architecture
- Testing / Regression
- Performance
- Adversarial Agent-Quality

## Evidence Package

- Atomic commit list and final integration commit.
- Requirement-to-test/evidence mapping for every owned `CURRENT`/`PLANNED` requirement.
- Test, static-analysis, architecture, golden, benchmark, browser, or GUT reports applicable to this phase.
- ADRs created/changed and evidence that public contracts match them.
- Verified review findings, remediation commits, and re-review disposition.
- Screenshots/video/interaction evidence only where automated evidence cannot sufficiently demonstrate the UX behaviour.

## Handoff Capsule

Create `traceability/handoffs/phase-10.md` from `contracts/handoff-capsule-template.md` only after this phase reaches `PASS`.

# Referenced Requirement Blocks

## REQ-GAME-023 — Game-Audio Features

- **Owner:** Phase 10 — Game-Audio Tooling
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 23 of the pre-hardening baseline

Game-specific functionality is a major product priority.

Target features include:

- Seamless-loop creation
- Loop-point editing
- Zero-crossing loop assistance
- Loop auditioning
- One-shot preparation
- Silence trimming
- Batch conversion
- Batch export
- Controlled random variation generation
- Sample-rate conversion
- Bit-depth conversion
- Mono/stereo conversion
- Loudness matching

---

## REQ-GAME-075 — Guided Task Workflows

- **Owner:** Phase 10 — Game-Audio Tooling
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 75 of the pre-hardening baseline

AudioGubbins shall provide task-oriented guided workflows without creating a separate restricted “beginner mode”.

Examples include:

- Prepare One-Shot
- Clean Dialogue
- Create Seamless Loop
- Normalise Game SFX
- Export for Godot

Guided workflows must produce the same underlying editable operations that an expert could create manually.

After completing a guided workflow, users must be able to inspect and modify the resulting:

- Regions
- Parameters
- Processor chain
- Loop metadata
- Export settings

This preserves approachability without creating a second, incompatible editing model.

---

## REQ-GAME-120 — Asset Groups and Inherited Game-Audio Policy

- **Owner:** Phase 10 — Game-Audio Tooling
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 120 of the pre-hardening baseline

Assets, regions, variation sets, and events may be organised into hierarchical logical groups such as:

- `Footsteps/Grass`
- `Footsteps/Metal`
- `Weapons/Pistol`
- `UI/Confirm`
- `Ambience/Forest`

Groups may provide inherited defaults for:

- Processing chains.
- Loudness targets.
- Export recipes.
- Naming templates.
- Destination paths.
- Runtime variation policies.
- Bus assignment.
- Tags.

Inheritance must be explicit and inspectable.

Per-object overrides must be clearly distinguishable from inherited values and must support reset-to-inherited behaviour.

The inheritance system must avoid hidden state that makes it difficult to determine an asset's effective configuration.

---

## REQ-GAME-121 — Seamless Loop Analysis and Validation

- **Owner:** Phase 10 — Game-Audio Tooling
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 121 of the pre-hardening baseline

Loop authoring shall include automatic quality analysis and diagnostics.

Potential checks include:

- Boundary discontinuity.
- DC mismatch.
- Level mismatch.
- Phase mismatch.
- Click/transient risk.
- Zero-crossing proximity.
- Spectral discontinuity.
- Crossfade suitability.
- Repeated-cycle stability.

AudioGubbins should be able to suggest candidate loop boundaries and appropriate micro-crossfades where beneficial while preserving user control.

Loop preview should support repeated cycling and stress-testing of the boundary.

Where target formats or Godot integration support loop metadata, exported configuration should preserve the intended loop semantics.

---

## REQ-GAME-122 — Game-Context Preview Simulator

- **Owner:** Phase 10 — Game-Audio Tooling
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 122 of the pre-hardening baseline

AudioGubbins should include a game-context preview environment so game audio can be evaluated under conditions closer to runtime use.

Preview capabilities may include:

- Rapid one-shot triggering.
- Variation-set selection.
- Pitch/gain randomisation.
- Repetition-avoidance simulation.
- Concurrency limits.
- Voice stealing.
- Cooldowns.
- Layered event playback where later supported.
- 2D/3D attenuation preview.
- Distance simulation.
- Panning/spatial movement preview.
- Bus/routing preview where practical.
- Deterministic seeded simulation.
- Event parameter manipulation.

The preview simulator should reuse the same authored rules and, where feasible, equivalent runtime-selection logic as the Godot runtime addon to minimise authoring/runtime surprises.

---

## REQ-EXEC-136 — AudioGubbins Agent Implementation Guardrails

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 136 of the pre-hardening baseline

This specification is intended to be implemented by an advanced coding agent. The agent must therefore follow explicit architectural guardrails rather than relying on generic coding slogans or default AI-generated project structure.

These guardrails are requirements, not optional style advice.

#### 136.1 Principles Are Heuristics, Not Excuses

The implementation agent must not apply slogans such as YAGNI, DRY, KISS, SOLID, or design-pattern names mechanically.

In particular:

- **YAGNI must not be used to reject future capabilities explicitly required by this specification.** Documented future multitrack, plugin, Godot runtime, cloud, automation, and other extension requirements are real architectural constraints even when their user-facing feature is scheduled later.
- **DRY must not force unrelated concepts into shared abstractions merely because their current code looks similar.** Prefer duplication over incorrect coupling when two concepts do not yet share a stable domain abstraction.
- **KISS must not be interpreted as "choose the least capable architecture".** Simplicity means clear boundaries and comprehensible design, not sacrificing robustness or future requirements.
- **SOLID must not be reduced to excessive interfaces, one-method classes, or dependency-injection ceremony.** Apply the underlying design intent where it improves cohesion and substitutability.
- A named design pattern is not evidence that a design is good. Patterns must solve an actual documented problem.

#### 136.2 No God Objects or Monolithic Modules

The implementation must not centralise unrelated responsibility into objects such as:

- `AppManager`.
- `AudioManager`.
- `ProjectManager`.
- `StateManager`.
- `GodService`-style orchestration classes.
- Giant stores that own unrelated domains.
- Mega-components containing workspace, audio, persistence, transport, and editing behaviour together.

Names such as `Manager`, `Service`, `Controller`, `Engine`, or `System` are permitted only when the implementation has a narrow, explicit, cohesive ownership boundary.

Modules should be organised around stable domain responsibilities and dependency direction.

#### 136.3 Cohesive Module Boundaries

Each module/package must have:

- A clearly stated responsibility.
- Explicit public contracts.
- Explicit dependencies.
- A reason for ownership of its state.
- Tests at the appropriate boundary.

Likely bounded areas include, subject to architecture refinement:

- Project domain.
- Asset/media domain.
- Timeline/edit domain.
- Command system.
- Undo/history.
- Persistence.
- Codec/import/export.
- DSP graph.
- Realtime playback.
- Recording.
- Analysis/waveform/spectral rendering.
- Workspace/UI shell.
- Godot interchange.
- Runtime event authoring.
- Capability detection.

Cross-domain access must occur through typed contracts rather than arbitrary imports into internal implementation details.

#### 136.4 Dependency Direction

Dependency direction must be deliberate and testable.

UI components must not become the authoritative owner of project/audio state.

UI code must not bypass the command/domain layer to mutate project data directly for convenience.

Persistence formats must not leak throughout the domain model.

Browser-specific API adapters must be isolated behind capabilities/contracts so that platform APIs do not become implicit global dependencies.

DSP domain logic should not depend on visual components.

Godot integration should consume stable interchange/domain contracts rather than reaching into unrelated editor internals.

#### 136.5 Avoid Premature Generic Abstractions

The agent must not create vague frameworks such as generic `BaseManager`, `AbstractThingFactory`, universal event buses, universal repositories, generic graph engines, or catch-all plugin systems before concrete domain requirements justify them.

Prefer:

1. A concrete cohesive implementation.
2. A second concrete use case when required.
3. Extraction of the stable shared concept only when the domain relationship is understood.

This rule does not prohibit intentionally designed extension points that are explicitly required by this specification.

#### 136.6 Avoid Hidden Coupling

Do not use implicit global mutable state as a shortcut.

Avoid hidden communication through:

- Global singleton bags.
- Unstructured event emitters.
- Stringly typed message names.
- Mutable module globals.
- DOM events as a substitute for domain contracts.
- Storage side effects as inter-module messaging.

Where event-driven communication is appropriate, events must be typed, scoped, documented, and owned by a clear subsystem.

#### 136.7 File and Function Size Review Thresholds

Source size thresholds are review triggers, not code-golf targets.

As a default:

- A production source file approaching roughly 300–400 logical lines should trigger a cohesion review.
- A function approaching roughly 50–70 logical lines should trigger a decomposition review.
- A class/object with a large number of unrelated methods or dependencies should trigger an ownership review even if its line count is small.

Exceeding a threshold is acceptable when cohesion genuinely warrants it and the reviewer records the justification.

Splitting one coherent concept into meaningless tiny files merely to satisfy a number is prohibited.

#### 136.8 Explicit Complexity Budgets

Each implementation phase must identify likely complexity hotspots.

Reviewers must actively inspect:

- Modules with unusually high dependency fan-in/fan-out.
- Deep inheritance trees.
- Large state stores.
- Highly connected event graphs.
- Repeated conditionals encoding the same domain rule.
- Functions with high branching complexity.
- Classes/modules that keep gaining unrelated responsibilities across phases.

Complexity must be reduced structurally rather than hidden behind comments or helper functions.

#### 136.9 No Phase Leakage

An implementation agent must not partially implement later phases opportunistically unless required to establish a stable current-phase contract.

If future capability requires an extension point now, implement the minimal robust contract needed now and document the deferred implementation.

Do not add half-working future features, dead UI, speculative configuration, or placeholder production APIs that will be mistaken for supported behaviour.

#### 136.10 No Permanent Temporary Hacks

Temporary compromises are allowed only when all of the following are true:

- They are necessary to unblock the current phase.
- They do not compromise data integrity or security.
- They are clearly marked in code and the phase record.
- They have an explicit removal task.
- The removal task is scheduled before the phase gate can pass unless the reviewer explicitly accepts the debt as non-blocking.

Comments such as `TODO later`, `temporary`, `quick fix`, or `hack` without a tracked remediation item are not acceptable.

#### 136.11 Domain Rules Must Have One Authoritative Home

Business/domain rules must not be independently reimplemented in UI, storage, worker, and Godot-integration layers.

Examples include:

- Selection precedence.
- Export collision policy.
- Event variation selection.
- Loop rules.
- Project-version compatibility rules.
- Command validation.

Presentation layers may adapt the result, but authoritative rules must have a single clear owner with direct tests.

This is the appropriate use of DRY: avoid duplicated **domain truth**, not superficial duplicated syntax.

#### 136.12 Typed Contracts and Runtime Validation

TypeScript compile-time typing is necessary but not sufficient at trust boundaries.

Use explicit schemas/runtime validation for:

- Project files.
- Portable bundles.
- Godot interchange manifests.
- Worker messages.
- Plugin/interchange data.
- Imported external metadata.
- Future network/cloud boundaries.

Internal contracts should avoid `any`, unbounded dictionaries, and stringly typed state when a domain type can express the invariant.

#### 136.13 Architecture Tests

Architecture constraints should be executable where practical.

The project should include automated tests/lint rules capable of detecting violations such as:

- Forbidden dependency directions.
- UI packages importing persistence internals.
- Runtime Godot code depending on editor-only APIs.
- Domain packages importing browser-specific adapters directly.
- Circular dependencies.
- Cross-package use of non-public internals.

Architecture tests are part of CI and phase review.

#### 136.14 Comments and Documentation

Comments should explain intent, invariants, non-obvious trade-offs, and reasons.

Do not generate commentary that merely restates code.

Public/domain contracts should be documented well enough for another agent or developer to use them without reading implementation internals.

Important architectural decisions should be captured as ADRs or equivalent decision records, especially where multiple valid designs were considered.

#### 136.15 Error Handling Must Be Designed

The agent must not use blanket `try/catch` blocks, silent fallbacks, or logging-and-continuing as substitutes for defined failure behaviour.

Each boundary should define:

- Recoverable errors.
- Fatal errors.
- User-actionable errors.
- Retryable errors.
- Data-integrity failures.
- Capability degradation.

Errors should preserve causal information and be presented to users at the correct abstraction level.

#### 136.16 Performance Must Not Destroy Architecture

Optimisation may introduce specialised paths, caches, worker pipelines, WASM, pooled resources, and GPU acceleration.

These optimisations must remain behind stable contracts so that performance code does not become the domain model.

Measure before and after optimisation.

Do not micro-optimise ordinary code while leaving architectural bottlenecks such as main-thread DSP, full-buffer copies, or excessive cross-thread serialisation unresolved.

#### 136.17 Reviewer Enforcement

Every phase's Architecture and Code Quality reviewers must explicitly answer:

- Did this phase introduce or enlarge a god object?
- Did any module gain unrelated responsibilities?
- Did the implementation introduce speculative abstractions without a concrete requirement?
- Did DRY/YAGNI/KISS/SOLID reasoning cause loss of required capability or incorrect coupling?
- Are dependency directions still valid?
- Is domain logic duplicated across layers?
- Are files/functions exceeding review thresholds still cohesive?
- Did UI code bypass typed command/domain APIs?
- Did temporary debt escape the phase without explicit acceptance?
- Can the next phase extend this work without invasive rewrites?

A blocking finding in these areas prevents the phase gate from passing.

---

## REQ-EXEC-167 — Agent Execution Contract

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 167 of the pre-hardening baseline

The implementation agent is expected to have full access to the AudioGubbins repository filesystem and the associated GitHub repository and to perform the implementation work directly from this specification.

This specification is the controlling implementation contract. The agent must not silently reinterpret, weaken, omit, postpone, stub, fake, or re-scope requirements because they are difficult, time-consuming, unfamiliar, or inconvenient.

The agent shall:

- Implement one gated phase at a time.
- Treat each phase TODO, invariant, required test, acceptance criterion, and review requirement as contractual.
- Preserve the architectural principles and dependency direction defined by this specification.
- Make reasonable autonomous implementation decisions where the specification intentionally leaves mechanism open.
- Record significant architectural decisions as ADRs.
- Prefer robust, explicit, maintainable architecture over expedient shortcuts.
- Refactor touched code when implementation reveals a poor abstraction rather than knowingly extending architectural debt.
- Keep unrelated sweeping rewrites outside the active phase unless they are necessary to satisfy a requirement or remove a blocking architectural defect.
- Leave the repository in a buildable, testable, reviewable state at meaningful checkpoints.

The agent must never use implementation speed or convenience as sufficient justification for reducing capability, correctness, test coverage, architectural quality, accessibility, determinism, portability, or maintainability.

---

## REQ-EXEC-170 — Independent Multi-Lens and Adversarial Review

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 170 of the pre-hardening baseline

The implementation agent may not approve its own phase.

Every phase must be reviewed through independent reviewer passes using fresh review instructions/context where practical. Reviews may be performed by separate subagents or by separate isolated reviewer invocations, but they must be operationally independent from the implementation pass.

The review system shall combine:

- Required specialist lenses defined elsewhere in this specification.
- Cross-cutting architecture review.
- Adversarial review intended to find hidden defects rather than validate the implementer's narrative.
- Requirement-compliance review against the actual phase contract.
- Regression review of previously completed phase invariants where affected.

Adversarial reviewers should actively attempt to discover:

- Missing requirements disguised as complete work.
- Incorrect assumptions about browser/platform behaviour.
- Race conditions and lifecycle bugs.
- Data-loss or recovery failures.
- Hidden coupling.
- God objects and overgrown services/managers.
- Incorrect ownership boundaries.
- UI logic bypassing the command/domain layer.
- Unbounded memory/storage behaviour.
- Audio-thread violations.
- Main-thread blocking.
- Non-deterministic final-render paths.
- Incorrect DSP edge cases.
- State corruption under failure/reload.
- Accessibility regressions.
- Mobile/touch regressions.
- Security/privacy leakage.
- Dependency or licence risks.
- Test suites that appear comprehensive but do not exercise real behaviour.
- Phase leakage or unscheduled future-work placeholders.

Reviewers must inspect implementation evidence rather than relying on the implementer's summary or checked TODO boxes.

---

## REQ-EXEC-171 — Review Finding Verification and Remediation

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 171 of the pre-hardening baseline

Reviewer findings are allegations until verified.

Before altering production code in response to a finding, the implementation workflow should verify the finding using the most appropriate evidence, including where relevant:

- Reproduction
- Targeted test
- Static analysis
- Type analysis
- Instrumentation
- Audio reference comparison
- Browser/platform reproduction
- Performance profiling
- Source/documentation verification
- Architectural dependency inspection

A reviewer finding that cannot be reproduced or substantiated must not be blindly implemented as a fix merely because a reviewer emitted it.

Verified genuine findings must be corrected unless this specification explicitly permits acceptance as tracked non-blocking debt.

Corrections must receive focused re-review, including:

- Confirmation that the original issue is resolved.
- Confirmation that the fix did not create a regression.
- Re-execution of affected tests and architecture checks.
- Re-review by the relevant specialist lens when severity warrants it.

When reviewers disagree, the workflow must reconcile the disagreement using evidence, specification requirements, and architectural principles rather than majority voting.

---

## REQ-EXEC-172 — Review Severity and Gate Semantics

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 172 of the pre-hardening baseline

All review findings shall use the following common severity taxonomy:

- **BLOCKER** — implementation cannot safely or meaningfully proceed or the phase cannot be considered implemented.
- **CRITICAL** — severe correctness, data-loss, security/privacy, architectural, audio-integrity, or release-quality defect.
- **HIGH** — substantial product, correctness, performance, compatibility, accessibility, maintainability, or architecture defect.
- **MEDIUM** — meaningful defect or debt that should normally be resolved within the phase unless explicitly justified and tracked.
- **LOW** — minor defect, maintainability improvement, polish issue, or low-risk edge case.
- **NOTE** — observation, future consideration, or non-actionable context.

Gate rules:

- BLOCKER, CRITICAL, and HIGH findings always fail the phase gate until resolved and verified.
- MEDIUM findings must be resolved or explicitly accepted with written rationale, ownership, and tracking.
- LOW findings may be deferred when justified and tracked.
- NOTE findings do not block the phase.

Severity must be based on impact and likelihood, not on how difficult the fix is.

The implementation agent may not downgrade severity merely to pass a gate.

---

## REQ-EXEC-173 — No Autonomous Scope Reduction

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 173 of the pre-hardening baseline

The implementation agent must never remove, downgrade, postpone, stub, fake, simplify away, or relabel required work as future scope because implementation is difficult or the phase is large.

If the work is too large to execute safely in one coding pass, the agent may subdivide the phase internally into ordered implementation slices, provided that:

- The externally defined phase boundary remains unchanged.
- Intermediate slices do not masquerade as a completed phase.
- The phase gate remains closed until every required slice is complete.
- Intermediate architectural decisions still satisfy the final phase contract.

Phrases such as the following are not acceptable substitutes for implementation unless the specification explicitly schedules the work later:

- "Future improvement"
- "Out of scope for now"
- "Can be added later"
- "MVP implementation"
- "Simplified implementation"
- "Temporary implementation"
- "Placeholder"
- "Good enough for this phase"

The specification, not the implementation agent, defines scope.

## REQ-EXEC-174 — TODO and Acceptance-Criteria Integrity

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 174 of the pre-hardening baseline

Phase TODOs are contractual implementation statements.

A TODO may be marked complete only when its stated behaviour exists and all associated tests, invariants, and acceptance criteria are satisfied.

Examples of invalid completion claims include:

- Marking a feature complete because interfaces/types exist but behaviour does not.
- Marking persistence complete because data can be written but recovery/failure cases are absent.
- Marking a DSP processor complete because nominal input works but edge cases/reference validation are missing.
- Marking accessibility complete because controls have ARIA attributes without keyboard/focus testing.
- Marking mobile support complete because a desktop layout technically renders on a phone.
- Marking Godot integration complete because files export but the specified editor/runtime contracts are absent.

Reviewers must independently spot-check TODO completion against actual code, tests, generated artefacts, and runtime behaviour.

TODO checkboxes must never be treated as proof.

---

## REQ-EXEC-180 — Test Integrity and Anti-Cheating Rules

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 180 of the pre-hardening baseline

Tests are evidence of behaviour, not obstacles to be weakened until a build turns green.

The implementation agent must not:

- Remove or weaken assertions merely to pass a test.
- Update golden/reference audio output without documented technical justification and reviewer verification.
- Replace integration/E2E coverage with easier unit mocks when the requirement is integration behaviour.
- Mock the subsystem whose integration behaviour is the subject of the test.
- Assert only implementation details while failing to verify user/domain outcomes.
- Swallow exceptions or convert hard failures into warnings to make tests pass.
- Disable flaky tests without root-cause analysis and tracking.
- Add arbitrary retries to hide races.
- Mark tests skipped/todo as a substitute for required coverage.
- Alter test fixtures so that they no longer represent the required scenario.

Audio/DSP tests should use objective reference signals, tolerances, invariants, and golden/reference renders where appropriate.

Critical persistence and recovery tests should exercise process/tab interruption, partial writes, stale caches, storage pressure, and incompatible schema behaviour rather than only happy paths.

Architecture tests should verify dependency direction and prohibited imports where practical.

---

## REQ-EXEC-181 — Placeholder, Stub, and Temporary-Code Gate Rule

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 181 of the pre-hardening baseline

Unless this specification explicitly schedules an implementation for a later phase, the following are gate failures when present in phase-owned production paths:

- `TODO`
- `FIXME`
- `HACK`
- Placeholder UI representing required behaviour
- Dummy or fabricated production data
- Empty implementations
- Unimplemented branches
- `throw new Error("Not implemented")` or equivalent
- Silent no-op fallbacks
- Temporary mock implementations
- Fake persistence
- Fake processing
- Hard-coded responses standing in for required systems
- Compatibility shims introduced contrary to the pre-1.0 schema policy
- Disabled required behaviour hidden behind an undocumented flag

A future-phase extension point is acceptable only when the current phase's required behaviour is complete and the extension point is an explicit architectural seam rather than a stub.

All temporary code must have an explicit specification-approved purpose and removal boundary.

---

## REQ-EXEC-183 — Phase Evidence Package

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 183 of the pre-hardening baseline

At the end of every implementation phase, the agent must produce a concise but complete evidence package for reviewers.

The package should include:

- Phase identifier and objective
- Completed TODO checklist
- Files/packages materially changed
- New or changed public/internal contracts
- ADRs created/updated
- Tests added/changed
- Commands used for verification
- Build/type/lint/test results
- Browser/device compatibility results required by the phase
- Performance measurements required by the phase
- Audio/DSP reference results required by the phase
- Storage/recovery results required by the phase
- Accessibility results required by the phase
- Known non-blocking limitations explicitly permitted by the specification
- Dependency additions/removals and their review
- Migration/schema impact
- Screenshots or recordings where visual/touch behaviour is part of acceptance evidence
- Reviewer findings and remediation status

The evidence package is not a substitute for reviewers inspecting the implementation. It is an index to the evidence they must verify.

---

## REQ-EXEC-184 — Architecture Enforcement Tests

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 184 of the pre-hardening baseline

AudioGubbins shall use executable architecture constraints where practical rather than relying solely on prose discipline.

Architecture tests/static rules should verify, where appropriate:

- Package dependency direction
- Prohibited cross-layer imports
- Domain code independence from React/UI implementation details
- UI inability to mutate authoritative domain state except through approved contracts/commands
- Separation of persistence from presentation
- Separation of DSP/audio-thread code from UI code
- No direct third-party implementation leakage across designated abstraction boundaries
- No circular dependencies
- Godot integration boundaries
- Browser capability access through approved capability adapters
- Diagnostic/telemetry restrictions

These tests should evolve with the architecture and be reviewed whenever package boundaries change.

An agent must not bypass an architecture test by weakening or deleting the rule unless the architectural change is deliberate, documented in an ADR, and approved by the architecture review lens.

---

## REQ-EXEC-204 — Phase Context Loading Protocol

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 204 of the pre-hardening baseline

Implementation agents must not be expected to repeatedly consume the entire full specification for every coding task.

For a phase, the agent shall load a bounded **Phase Context Pack** consisting of:

1. Global Agent Execution Contract.
2. Global architectural invariants.
3. Current Phase Packet.
4. Normative requirements explicitly referenced by that packet.
5. Public contracts/interfaces from prerequisite phases that the phase depends upon.
6. Previous phase handoff/evidence summary where directly relevant.
7. Current Architecture Decision Records referenced by the phase.
8. Current implementation ledger entries relevant to owned packages.

The agent may consult additional specification sections when necessary, but implementation must not rely on remembering unrelated sections from a previous context window.

Phase packets must reference requirements explicitly rather than saying things such as `follow the audio requirements above`.

---

## REQ-EXEC-215 — Requirements-to-Tests Rule

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 215 of the pre-hardening baseline

Every normative behaviour that can be mechanically verified should have at least one identified verification mechanism before its implementation phase passes.

Verification mechanisms may include:

- Unit tests.
- Property-based tests.
- Integration tests.
- Browser/E2E tests.
- Audio golden/reference tests.
- Deterministic render hashes.
- GUT/Godot tests.
- Architecture tests.
- Accessibility automation plus manual checks.
- Performance/latency measurements.
- Static analysis.
- Manual evidence for behaviours that cannot be meaningfully automated.

A requirement must not be considered satisfied solely because code that appears related to it exists.

---

## REQ-EXEC-216 — No Hidden Implementation Assumptions

- **Owner:** Phase 00 — Requirements and Architectural Baseline
- **Scope:** `CURRENT`
- **Legacy source:** section 216 of the pre-hardening baseline

Phase packets shall explicitly state assumptions that materially affect correctness.

Agents must not silently assume:

- Browser APIs are universally available.
- A file fits in memory.
- Audio is stereo.
- Sample rates match.
- A Godot project is writable.
- A user is online.
- A PWA is installed.
- SharedArrayBuffer/WebGPU is available.
- Touch input implies no keyboard/mouse.
- Export destinations can be overwritten.
- External files remain unchanged.
- Storage quota is sufficient.
- A processor is zero-latency.

Capability-sensitive assumptions require explicit fallback/error behaviour.

# Relevant Accepted ADRs

<!-- adr/ADR-0009-design-system-boundary.md -->

# ADR-0009 — Design-System Boundary and Trigger Composition

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Every third-party UI primitive is reached only through `@audiogubbins/design-system`, which exposes AudioGubbins-named components narrower than the library beneath them. A control that has to be two things at once, such as a menu bar's trigger or a toolbar button with a hint, is supplied as one composed primitive (`MenuBarMenu`, `ControlBarButton`) rather than assembled at the call site by nesting wrappers.
- **Drivers:** one place to solve focus, naming, roles and inertness; a call site that cannot assemble an inaccessible control; the ability to replace the primitive library without touching features.
- **Constraints:** `asChild` composition only works while every component in the chain passes its props and its ref to a real element, so a wrapper whose root is another component may never be nested inside one. A composed primitive states the reason in its documentation, and a component test proves the composed control is reachable with one Tab.
- **Related requirements:** `REQ-UX-155`, `REQ-UX-005`, `REQ-EXEC-184`.

<!-- adr/ADR-0010-workspace-layout-ownership.md -->

# ADR-0010 — Workspace Layout Ownership

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The docking engine is confined to one adapter module, and AudioGubbins stores its own layout shape: which panels are open, which group holds each, which is active and what proportion each group takes. The engine's serialised form is never persisted. A preset names the panel the user starts in, so a layout is complete before anything mounts it.
- **Drivers:** replacing or upgrading the docking engine must not migrate every user's saved workspaces; a layout has to be validated, recovered and reasoned about without a browser.
- **Constraints:** the adapter is the only module that may import the engine, enforced by the architecture rules. Anything the engine does that AudioGubbins cannot express in its own layout is not persisted. A stored layout naming a panel this build does not have falls back to a preset rather than failing to mount.
- **Related requirements:** `REQ-ARCH-151`, `REQ-UX-058`, `REQ-UX-059`, `REQ-EXEC-184`.

<!-- adr/ADR-0011-partitioned-stores.md -->

# ADR-0011 — Partitioned External Stores

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Shell state is held in small external stores, one per ownership area (preferences, workspace, interaction), each created once in the composition root, passed to what needs it and read through `useSyncExternalStore`. There is no global store, no application context holding unrelated domains, and no module-level mutable singleton reached by import.
- **Drivers:** state partitioned by ownership; a store testable without React; a composition root that is the only place knowing what the real clock, storage and capability probes are.
- **Constraints:** a store exposes its members as properties rather than methods, so a reader cannot capture an unbound method. Authoritative project and audio state does not live here, and React never owns high-frequency state.
- **Related requirements:** `REQ-ARCH-153`, `REQ-EXEC-136.4`, `REQ-EDIT-073`.

<!-- adr/ADR-0016-version-registry-package.md -->

# ADR-0016 — The Version Registry Is Its Own Leaf Package

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The product version and the version of every persisted format are generated from `version.json` into `packages/version` (`@audiogubbins/version`), a package with no dependencies whose whole source is the generated module. It is the TypeScript counterpart of `crates/audiogubbins-version`. A package that writes or reads a versioned format depends on it directly; the diagnostics package depends on it to stamp a bundle and to report the format versions in it.
- **Drivers:** the registry was generated into `packages/diagnostics`, so the design system and the workspace package each depended on the logging package for one constant, and any later package that persisted anything would have done the same. That made the logging package a dependency of everything for a reason unrelated to logging, and put a version question behind a package whose job is diagnostics (review finding F-27). `REQ-REPO-187` keeps product and format versions in one source, and `REQ-REPO-154` requires dependency direction to reflect ownership.
- **Constraints:** the package holds generated constants and nothing else; `pnpm version:check` fails if it differs from `version.json`, and the architecture rules keep it a leaf. It is a package rather than a module in `packages/domain` because the design system must not depend on the domain, and the formats it versions (preferences, workspace layouts, shortcut profiles, diagnostic bundles) are not domain concepts. It does not introduce a package for appearance's sake: it removes a dependency edge from two packages and replaces a false one on a third.
- **Change record:** affected requirements `REQ-REPO-154`, `REQ-REPO-187`; affected phase 01, whose owned modules gain `packages/version`; compatibility impact none, because every constant keeps its name and value; already-passed phase remediation none; verification by the version freshness gate and the architecture layering rules, which now name the package.
- **Related requirements:** `REQ-REPO-154`, `REQ-REPO-185`, `REQ-REPO-186`, `REQ-REPO-187`, `REQ-EXEC-184`.

<!-- adr/ADR-0017-input-model-package.md -->

# ADR-0017 — The Input Model Is One Package, With Nothing of the Browser

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Mouse, touch, pen and keyboard input are modelled as values in `packages/input` (`@audiogubbins/input`): the pointer sample, the gesture and its recogniser, tool strength with pressure optional, the key press, and the translation of a pointer event or a key event into those values. A browser event is read through a structural type naming only the fields a value is built from, so the package is compiled without the browser's type definitions and depends on no other AudioGubbins package (amended by `ADR-0018`: it depends on `packages/text`, and on nothing else). The command layer depends on it, because a shortcut is a sequence of key presses bound to a command; the application reads key events through it; an editing canvas will read pointer events through it.
- **Drivers:** WU-01.D asks for one input abstraction over mouse, touch, pen and keyboard, and `REQ-UX-005` makes each first-class. The pointer half lived in the design system, which owns presentation (`REQ-UX-155`), and the keyboard half in the command layer and the application's shortcut hook, so one model had three homes and none of them was about input (review finding F-29). `REQ-REPO-154` requires package boundaries to follow ownership.
- **Constraints:** nothing here knows the browser, a component, a command or a theme; the architecture rules keep it a leaf and forbid a browser global in it, as in the domain and the command layer. Whether a device offers pressure is a capability question and stays with the capability package; this package only carries what a device reported. What a gesture does in an editing canvas is the canvas's decision. `GestureSettings` is a value with a default and no owner in the preference contract: `REQ-UX-068` requires a user to be able to choose fixed strength over pressure, and Phase 01 has no tool whose strength could vary, so nothing persists the choice and no control offers it. The phase that adds the first pressure-sensitive tool adds both, and until then the default stands. Recorded as a known limitation of the Phase 01 evidence rather than left to be noticed later (review finding F-65).
- **Change record:** affected requirements `REQ-UX-005`, `REQ-UX-067`, `REQ-UX-068`, `REQ-REPO-154`; affected phase 01, whose owned modules gain `packages/input`; compatibility impact none, because no persisted format holds these values in a new shape and the key press keeps its fields; already-passed phase remediation none; verification by the moved pointer tests, new key-press tests and the architecture layering rules, which name the package.
- **Amended by:** `ADR-0018`, in the clause above that this package depends on no other AudioGubbins package. It depends on `packages/text` for the characters a reader sees, which the rule for a key's label needs, and on nothing else. Every other clause stands.
- **Related requirements:** `REQ-UX-005`, `REQ-UX-066`, `REQ-UX-067`, `REQ-UX-068`, `REQ-REPO-154`, `REQ-EXEC-184`.

<!-- adr/ADR-0018-reader-facing-text-package.md -->

# ADR-0018 — The Rules For Text A Reader Is Shown Are One Leaf Package

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The rules a sentence shown to a reader, or read to one, is held to live in `packages/text` (`@audiogubbins/text`): the characters a reader sees and how many a text holds, how many bytes a text takes in UTF-8, the quoting of a stored or imported value a refusal names, the cut at the last word that fits in code units and in characters, the cut at a whole sentence, a reader's own text kept to a size on a whole character, the shape of a name a reader gives, held without the space around it, when two names are one, the first name free of those in use and what a copy is called, the identifier derived from a name, which storage keys and a message or a file name quotes, and the shape an identifier read from storage is held to, each within the bound in bytes its caller gives, which entry of a list holds a name, the names a list holds, asked of many times as numbering asks, and whether this runtime compares names by the rule, and the identifier each entry is held under beside the others (the count and the size amended in the fourteenth round, F-813; the cut in characters, the shape of a name, the comparison of two, the first free name and the identifier in the eighteenth, F-970, F-982, F-978 and F-971; the holder of a name and the identifiers a list holds in the nineteenth, F-1012 and F-1023; the shape and bound of a stored identifier in the twentieth, F-1038, and the names a list holds and whether names can be compared in the same round, F-1061 and F-1041; the bound given by each caller, and the bytes a text takes, in the twenty-first, F-1074). It is a leaf with no dependencies (narrowed by `ADR-0019`: its tests may take the fixtures package, and nothing it ships does), compiled without the browser's type definitions, and it knows nothing of the domain, a command or a theme. `packages/input` depends on it, and on nothing else, for the characters a reader sees; `packages/commands` depends on it to quote a value a refusal names, to hold a profile's name to the shape of a name, to find the profile that holds a name, to name a copy nobody named and number a profile imported under a name another profile has, and to hold each profile under an identifier derived from its name, and a stored profile's identifier to the shape one is derived in, within a bound of its own that it derives from the ending it writes after a profile's identifier, counted in UTF-8 bytes by this package (amended in the eighteenth round, F-970, F-978, F-971 and F-982, where it counted the name's characters itself and derived the identifier itself, and in the nineteenth, F-1012, where it compared the names held and numbered the identifiers itself, and the stored identifier's shape in the twentieth, F-1038, and the bound in the twenty-first, F-1074, where this package set it); `packages/workspace` depends on it to quote a value a refusal names, to hold a workspace's name to the shape of a name, to find the workspace that holds a name as a reader hears it, to name a copy nobody named, and a workspace saved with no name, by the first free name, cut at a word in the characters the name's bound counts, and to hold each workspace under an identifier derived from its name, and a stored workspace's identifier to the shape one is derived in, within 227 bytes, the bound storage holds a layout's identifier to, which no file name sets (the count amended in the fifteenth round, F-864, the cut in the seventeenth, F-936, the shape, the comparison, the first free name and the identifier in the eighteenth, F-970, F-978, F-971 and F-982, and the holder and the identifiers in the nineteenth, F-1012, and the stored identifier's shape in the twentieth, F-1038, and the bound in the twenty-first, F-1074, where this package set it from a file's name); `packages/diagnostics` depends on it to keep a reproduction note to its size (amended in the fourteenth round, F-813); `packages/capabilities` depends on it to probe whether names can be compared here, by the check every comparison reads (since the twentieth round, F-1041); `apps/web` depends on it for the cut of a reason at a word and the cut of a notice at a sentence (amended in the twenty-first round, F-1069 and F-1078, where it also quoted a file's name through `asQuoted`, which cut it, and asked whether names can be compared where the built-in shortcuts cannot be copied, which it reads from the command layer's refusal). This amends the clause of `ADR-0017` that the input package depends on no other AudioGubbins package: it depends on this one, which sits below it, and on nothing else.
- **Drivers:** one rule for the characters a reader sees was written in the input package, because a key's label needed it first, and the rule for quoting a value was written in the diagnostics package, because the two packages that quoted one shared that package and nothing below it. Neither could reach the other, so the quoting bound counted code units and moved its cut back from half a surrogate pair alone: a letter was still cut from the combining mark a reader sees on it, and that was written down as an accepted cost rather than fixed (review findings F-738, F-721). The diagnostics package's description then needed "and" to cover a responsibility that is neither logging nor a bundle, in four places at once, and a module that needs "and" to describe it is two modules. Three different cuts of text a reader is shown had by then been written in three packages, only one of them guarded against cutting a character in half, and they meet in one sentence that reaches an assertive live region. `REQ-REPO-154` requires package boundaries to follow ownership.
- **Constraints:** the package holds text rules and nothing else, and the architecture rules keep it a leaf. Its entry point offers the fourteen rules its consumers use (four until the fourteenth round, F-813, six until the eighteenth, F-970, F-971, F-978 and F-982, eleven until the twentieth, F-1038, which added `isIdentifier`, and twelve until F-1061 and F-1041 in the same round added `namesHeldBy` and `namesCanBeCompared`; `holderOf` and `identifiersHeldBy` stand where `sameName` and `freeIdentifier` stood until the nineteenth, F-1012, and `identifierRule` and `utf8Bytes` where `identifiersHeldBy` and `isIdentifier` stood until the twenty-first, F-1074) and not the pieces they are built from, the segmenter, the count of the characters a reader sees, the comparison of two names and the cut to a bound that adds an ellipsis, so a caller that wants another cut or another count reads one of these rather than assembling another. `wholeCharactersWithin` is offered as a rule, not as one of those pieces: it keeps a reader's own text, such as a reproduction note, to a size and adds nothing to say it was cut, because the reader wrote it and sees it whole where they wrote it; that the ellipsis cut and the cut at a word are built on it inside the package is the package's business. The dependency `ADR-0017` forbade is permitted for this package alone, and the cruiser rule that keeps the input package a leaf names it: the input model still sits below the command layer, still knows nothing of the browser, and gains no second edge. A text rule that belongs to one reader of it — what a key is called on a layout, how a log record is redacted — stays with that reader, because it is about what the text means there; this package holds the rules about the shape of text a reader is shown or read, how it is measured, cut, quoted and compared, whichever package shows it, and the identifier derived from a name, because that identifier is readable text that storage keys and a message or a file name quotes, so a rule for it is a rule for text a reader is shown; nine of the fourteen are built on its one reading of the characters a reader sees (eight until the twentieth round, F-1038, when an identifier came to be cut at a whole character to its bound, which `isIdentifier` and `identifiersHeldBy` read, and ten until the twenty-first, F-1074, when the two became the one rule `identifierRule` and `utf8Bytes`, which reads no character a reader sees, came to the entry point). How many packages read a rule is not the test: most of the fourteen have one reader today (restated in the fifteenth round, F-855, where this clause said the package holds only what more than one reader needs). The package has one responsibility, the rules for text a reader is shown: its measure, its cut, its quoting, its comparison, and the identifiers named from it. Each of the fourteen rules is one of those: the holder of a name is the comparison read over a list, the names a list holds are that comparison read over a list sorted by it, whether names can be compared is the comparison's own condition, the identifier rule within its caller's bound answers the identifiers a list holds, the rule read over a list, and the shape a stored identifier is held to, the rule's result stated as a test, and the bytes a text takes are its size in the unit that bound is written in, so none is a second responsibility, and the package's description names the one (reviewed against the description test of `CLAUDE.md` G1 in the nineteenth round, F-1006, when the name rules, the comparison and the identifiers had made the description false).
- **Change record:** affected requirements `REQ-REPO-154`, `REQ-UX-005`, `REQ-UX-066`; affected phase 01, whose owned modules gain `packages/text`; affected `ADR-0017`, whose leaf clause is amended here and nowhere else; compatibility impact: names cut by these rules, a copy's and that of a workspace saved with no name, and identifiers derived by them are stored in `audiogubbins.workspaces` and `audiogubbins.shortcuts`, so a change to the cut or the derivation changes what a later save writes, and, where a stored identifier or the name of the workspace on screen clashes with one held, what it is read under, while a stored name and a stored identifier that clash with none are read as they are stored (corrected in the nineteenth round, F-1006, where this clause said no persisted format holds text cut by these rules), and a stored identifier out of the shape an identifier is derived in, or past its bound, is read as text that cannot be read: the shortcut profile or the workspace stored under it is left out, with a notice, its collection's text set aside as for any other entry that cannot be read, never kept under it nor renamed without a word (since the twentieth round, F-1038, where such an identifier was kept as stored and became the name of an exported profile's file and the words of the announcement); every quoted value keeps its bound, and a rule of this package decides whether a stored name is read. A stored workspace whose name is longer than 120 characters is left out of the saved workspaces, with a notice and its text set aside, and a stored shortcut profile whose name is longer than 120 characters is left out, with a notice, the stored text it came in set aside under `audiogubbins.shortcuts.unreadable` before anything is written over it, and the profiles' write withheld and tried again with every write where there is no room to set it aside (amended in the eighteenth round, F-973, where this clause said the profile was left out with a log record). No build has shipped, so no stored data is affected (corrected in the sixteenth round, F-902, where this clause said the impact was none; the bound on a stored workspace's name came in the fifteenth round, F-864, and a stored profile's name, bounded since the tenth, is counted so since the fifteenth, F-850); already-passed phase remediation none; verification by the moved quoting tests, new tests for each cut and for the browser without a segmenter, and the architecture layering rules, which name the package.
- **Amended:** in the fourteenth review round, in two clauses (review finding F-813). Two more surfaces had text a reader writes or is told about measured in code units: a reproduction note cut at its bound wherever the bound fell, and a profile name refused as "longer than 120 characters" by its code units, so a name of sixty emoji was refused. The entry point offers two more rules for them: `wholeCharactersWithin`, which keeps a reader's own text to a size on a whole character and adds nothing to say it was cut, and `longerThan`, which counts the characters a reader sees and reads no further than the one past the bound. Since the fifteenth round (F-850), a character longer than any real one counts once for each allowance it fills, so a bound in characters is also a bound in size, and the checks on a profile's name and a workspace's name rely on it for that (stated here in the sixteenth round, F-902). `packages/diagnostics` depends on this package for the first, which cannot close a cycle because this package depends on nothing; `packages/commands` read the second (superseded in the eighteenth round, F-970, when `longerThan` left the entry point and the command layer came to read the bound through `asName` and `asWrittenName`). The clause that the entry point offers four rules now reads six, and the list of consumers gains diagnostics; until the fifteenth round (F-855) this row said so and the two clauses did not, and the Decision and Constraints clauses now read so where they stand. The architecture rules keep the package a leaf and framework-free by name, which the verification clause above claimed and the rules did not do until this round. Since the seventeenth round (F-936), the ellipsis a cut adds is counted inside the cut's bound, so a caller passes the room it has rather than allowing for a character added past it, and the cut at a word keeps a word the cut ends exactly at, which is the bound less the ellipsis (corrected in the eighteenth round, F-984, where this row said the bound). Since the eighteenth round (F-970, F-978, F-982, F-971), the entry point offers `asName`, the shape of a name, which answers `blank` for a value that is not text as for one of nothing but space and `too-long` for one past its bound, so each package words each part of the rule once; a name given, whether typed, carried in a file or made for a copy, is held without the space around it, trimmed before the rule reads it and before it is numbered, and `asWrittenName` holds a name in stored text to the same rule and keeps it as it is written, so a stored name is read as it was stored; `sameName`, which holds two names to be one where they differ only in case, in how a letter is encoded, or in space, trimmed and each run inside one space, as a screen reader says them alike, and by which the workspace refuses a name another workspace has, and the command layer a name typed for a profile that another has; `firstFreeName`, the first of a name, then of the name with a number after it, that no name in use has, the name cut at a word in the characters `longerThan` counts to leave room for what follows it, by which each package names a workspace or a profile nobody named and the command layer numbers a profile imported under a name another profile has, where a cut in code units kept half the characters its bound allows of a name outside the basic plane; `firstFreeCopyName`, the first free of the name with the word a copy adds after it (" copy" in the eighteenth round, the word the caller gives since the nineteenth, F-1004), then with a number after that, cut the same way, by which each package names a copy nobody named, and by which a copy of a name that is itself a copy's, "<stem> copy" or "<stem> copy <number>", takes the stem's next free number, so a copy of "Editing copy" is "Editing copy 2" rather than "Editing copy copy"; and `freeIdentifier`, the identifier derived from a name, in lower case, each run of anything but a letter or a digit one hyphen and the caller's word where nothing is left, then numbered until no identifier in use has it, which the workspace and the command layer each derived for themselves, and which belongs here because the identifier is readable text that storage keys and a message or a file name quotes. `longerThan` and the cut at a word in characters are not on the entry point: the two name rules read the first through `asName` and `asWrittenName`, and `firstFreeName` and `firstFreeCopyName` read the second inside the package. The clause that the entry point offers six rules now reads eleven. Since the nineteenth round (F-999, F-1001, F-1004, F-1012 and F-1023), two names are compared by English collation with every option that decides whether two names are one stated, punctuation not ignored and digits compared as they are written, on every machine, because a name travels in an exported file and is refused or numbered on the machine it is imported on, where the reader's language made Turkish hold "MIXING" and "mixing" to be two names, Danish "Gaard" and "Gård" to be one, and Thai ignore punctuation, and the rule refuses to load where the runtime resolves another collation, ignores punctuation or reads digits as numbers; the identifier derived from a name keeps the letters, marks and digits of every script, taken from the name's compatibility form (NFKC) in a lower case without a locale, where it kept the letters a to z alone, so "Écoute" gave `coute` and a name in Cyrillic the caller's word; `firstFreeCopyName` takes the word a copy adds from the package that names the copy, which words it for its reader, reads a copy's series by that word as `sameName` compares a name, so a copy of "Editing Copy" is "Editing copy 2", and counts the word in the characters the bound counts; and `holderOf`, the entry of a list other than the one a name is being given to whose name is that name as a reader hears it, and `identifiersHeldBy`, the identifiers a list of entries holds, from which each entry added is given the one derived from its name or, for an entry read from storage, its own where it is free, numbered from two where the one it would take is held, take the place of `sameName` and `freeIdentifier` on the entry point, so the workspace and the command layer each keep their list and word their refusal and neither writes the rule. The identifiers a list holds are read as a set, and each count resumes where the last under the same identifier stopped, which is the first free number because nothing held is let go while the set lives, so an allocation costs about the same however many entries share its identifier, where counting from two for each entry over every entry held made a list read from storage take time that grew with the cube of its length. Since the twentieth round (F-1038), `isIdentifier` holds exactly the identifiers the package gives, one that is not empty and is its own identifier, so letters, marks and digits of any script in their compatibility form and lower case, in runs joined by single hyphens, with no hyphen at either end, where a stored `Mine` would sit beside the `mine` its name derives, and within its bound, in UTF-8 bytes (one bound for every caller until the twenty-first round, F-1074, set here from the name of a file a caller writes, when each caller came to give its own); a name's identifier is cut at a whole character to the bound, and cut again before it is numbered, so every identifier derived, numbered or not, is one it accepts, where 120 letters in Cyrillic derived 240 bytes; and `identifiersHeldBy` holds an identifier read from storage only where it accepts it, answering none, and holding none, for one it refuses, which the workspace's reading and the command layer's restore of a stored list each read as an entry that cannot be read. Since the twentieth round (F-1041), the collation is resolved once and held to the rule at the capability probe at start or at the first comparison, whichever comes first, never where the package loads (corrected in the twenty-first round, F-1091, where this clause placed it at the first comparison alone), where the refusal to load stopped every package that reads this one, the logger and the keyboard among them, and the page started blank with nothing said: `namesCanBeCompared` is the one statement of the check, which every comparison reads, and a comparison asked where it does not hold throws, a caller's fault, since each caller asks first. A runtime that fails it stops naming alone, and says so through the unsupported-capability path: the capabilities package probes the check at start as the name-comparison capability, which the status bar counts among the missing and the Capabilities panel explains under "Naming workspaces and shortcut profiles", and saving a workspace as a new one, copying or renaming a workspace, importing a profile and changing the built-in shortcuts, which are changed in a copy that is named, are unavailable with a sentence that names that feature and the panel; the layout store and the command layer refuse the same operations in words of their own for any caller that does not ask first. It does not stop the rest of this package, nor the start: the stored workspaces and profiles are read, each name as it is stored, and the workspace on screen is placed among them under the name it has, since whether another has that name cannot be decided, so it may be listed beside a workspace of its name, as two stored ones of one name are. Since the same round (F-1061), `namesHeldBy` holds the names of a list, other than the entry a name is being given to, sorted by the collator names are compared by, and answers which entry holds a name, and whether one is taken, by a binary search with the same collator, so numbering a name beside a list that holds it with every number to thousands costs comparisons that grow as n log n, where asking `holderOf` of every entry for each number made the start, which numbers the workspace on screen, grow with the square of the stored collection; sorted by the collator rather than keyed by a folding of the text, because the collator holds two names one that differ in a code point it ignores, a soft hyphen or a joiner, which no folding sees. `holderOf` stays for one question of a list. Since the twenty-first round (F-1074, F-1089 and F-1091), the identifier rule takes its bound from its caller: `identifierRule(longestBytes)` answers `isIdentifier` and `identifiersHeldBy`, and derives and numbers within that bound, and `utf8Bytes` counts a text's bytes in the unit a bound is written in, so this package knows no name a caller gives a file; the command layer derives its bound from the ending it writes after a profile's identifier, and the workspace holds a layout's identifier to 227 bytes, the bound storage holds it to, which no file name sets, so no stored layout changes verdict. An identifier keeps no code point a reader does not see, `\p{Default_Ignorable_Code_Point}`, and derives each as it looks: one that is not a letter, a variation selector, U+034F, a Mongolian free variation selector, a joiner or non-joiner, a soft hyphen, a zero-width space, a tag, or one not yet assigned, which a runtime that does not know it shows as nothing, is left out of the name before anything else reads it and adds nothing, so "Mix", a zero-width joiner and "ing" give `mixing`, and a mark after one reaches its letter; the four that are letters, the Hangul fillers U+115F, U+1160, U+3164 and U+FFA0, which show as a blank gap, separate as a space does, so `a`, U+3164 and `b` give `a-b`. A name of nothing but such code points and space is refused as blank, given or written, since a list would show it as nothing. The names Windows reserves for a device, `con`, `prn`, `aux`, `nul`, `com0` to `com9` and `lpt0` to `lpt9`, compared after the derivation, are never an identifier, because Windows reserves the name of a file before its first dot whatever follows it, and a browser renames a download so named: a name that derives one is numbered from two as a clash is, "Con" as `con-2`, and `isIdentifier` refuses one, so a profile or a workspace stored under one, or under an identifier holding a code point a reader does not see, is set aside with a notice. A runtime whose collator cannot be made fails the check as one that resolves another collation does, answered once and held, so the probe and every comparison read one answer, and a comparison asked there throws the package's refusal. Every other clause stands.

# ADR-0019 — The Text And Diagnostics Packages' Tests May Take The Test Fixtures Package

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The tests of `packages/text` and `packages/diagnostics` may import `@audiogubbins/test-fixtures`, and so may the tests of every package that no rule of its own in the cruise governs. The tests of `packages/input` and `packages/version` may not, and those of `packages/domain` cannot, since the fixtures package depends on it. A package whose tests take it declares it as a development dependency, through the `devDeps` of its entry in the graph's declaration in `tools/sync-workspace-graph.mjs`, which writes it into the package's manifest and its compiler project's references, and which refuses any other package there. The cruise's rules `text-owns-nothing-else` and `diagnostics-owns-nothing-else` leave the fixtures package out of what they refuse (`to.pathNot`), and refuse every other package as before; `domain-owns-nothing-else`, `input-owns-nothing-else` and `version-owns-nothing-else` leave nothing out. Beside its generated fixtures, the fixtures package holds two measures: `relativeCost`, the processor time one workload takes against another, the two read in turn in blocks, which the cost tests of the text, diagnostics and application packages share; and `comparisonsIn`, the number of comparisons of names a piece of work makes, counted at the collator, which the cost tests of the commands and workspace packages share. Every test that reads `relativeCost`, itself or through a helper of its file, is allowed `LONGEST_COST_TEST_MS`, 520 seconds by the clock, as its timeout, which an architecture rule holds each to. The figure is derived in the package from the measure's own cap: the two first readings, `LONGEST_US` (32 seconds of processor time) of pairs of blocks, and one pair more whose blocks each take up to a reading more than the longer first reading, where the longest one reading the measure allows (`LONGEST_READING_US`) is 12 seconds, which comes to 104 seconds of processor time, taken five times (`CLOCK_OVER_PROCESSOR`) for the clock with forty busy processes beside the tests. That longest reading is about twice the longest reading any proven defect makes on a quiet machine, about 5.8 seconds, so a defect's reading under load stays within it and the defect fails on its ratio. The measure enforces that longest reading: a reading of either side that costs more ends it with a failure naming the side, the reading's cost and the 12 seconds, so the bound holds of every measure it answers, and a slower defect fails on its first such reading rather than at the timeout. `comparisonsIn` takes a ceiling, past which the comparison it counts throws a failure naming it: a count test takes the count at a thousand names and holds the count at four thousand to `N_LOG_N_FOURFOLD`, 5.5, times it, above the 4.8 of work that grows as n log n and under the 5.8 of n log² n, with that as the ceiling, so a quadratic defect is stopped in its first moments and each count test keeps Vitest's default timeout. Five packages declare it as a development dependency: the text and diagnostics packages, and the commands and workspace packages and the application, which no rule of their own governs.
- **Drivers:** the cost tests of three packages at three layers need one measure. The redaction tests held a text against prose of the same length with a helper of their own, which read one side whole and then the other, so a change in the machine's speed between the two fell on one side alone (review finding F-1036). The identifier cost tests counted the reads of one kind of collection, so a quadratic search through any other passed them (F-1054). The owner decided that both move to one fixed helper that reads the two sides alternately in blocks. The cost tests of numbering in the commands and workspace packages counted the comparisons of names with a copy of one function in each package's tests (F-1061), which the twentieth round's reading of its whole change found; a count is a measure of cost too, so it lives once, beside the other. The text package sits at the bottom of the graph, and the diagnostics package just above it, so the only package all three can reach is one their tests may take. The fixtures package is that package by its purpose (`REQ-REPO-191`), and its leaf rules were the only thing that refused it. A copy in each package would be three measures that drift apart, and a home in the text package would put a measure of processor time among the rules for text a reader is shown.
- **Constraints:** only test code gains the edge. `fixtures-are-test-only` still refuses the fixtures package from every production file (`REQ-EXEC-181`), and no manifest declares it as a runtime dependency, which the architecture rules check. No test of the input or version package needs the fixtures package, and an edge nobody uses is one the layering would allow for no reason, so their rules still refuse it, in their tests as in their production code. The domain package's tests cannot take it: the fixtures package depends on the domain package, so the edge would close a cycle between the two packages, and `domain-owns-nothing-else` refuses it as well. Every other package those rules refuse stays refused, in a package's tests as in its production code. The fixtures package depends on `packages/domain` alone, so the text and diagnostics packages' tests reach the domain through it, and nothing either package ships does. Neither measure generates anything, and `PROVENANCE.md` says so beside the generated set. `relativeCost` reads the machine it runs on and answers a ratio; it reads Node's processor time through a structural type naming the one call it makes, because each package's entry point is compiled without Node's types, as the input package reads a browser event (`ADR-0017`). `comparisonsIn` reads no machine time: it counts the comparisons a collator makes while the work runs, through the collator's own `compare`, and leaves the collator as it was whether the work returns or throws, so a limit held to its count holds on any machine and under any load. The leaf clause of `ADR-0018` stands for everything the text package ships.
- **Change record:** affected requirements `REQ-REPO-154`, `REQ-REPO-186`, `REQ-REPO-191`, `REQ-EXEC-181`, `REQ-EXEC-184`. Affected phase 01, whose text, diagnostics, commands and workspace packages and application gain a development dependency on the fixtures package. Affected `ADR-0018`, whose leaf clause this narrows for test code alone. Compatibility impact none, because nothing is persisted and nothing shipped changes. Already-passed phase remediation none. Verification by the dependency cruise (`pnpm test:dependencies`), the architecture rules on manifests and on the fixtures package, the generated graph (`pnpm graph:check`), and the fixtures package's own tests of the two measures; the count reads no machine time, so its tests and those it serves read the same on a quiet machine and a busy one. Three standing rules hold the edge to what this decision allows: the rule over each package's own rule in the cruise requires its `to.pathNot` to be `^packages/test-fixtures/` on the text and diagnostics packages' rules and absent on every other; a rule over every manifest requires each AudioGubbins development dependency of a package or the application to be the fixtures package, taken by some test of that package; and the graph's declaration refuses a `devDeps` entry that names any other package, before it writes or checks anything.

# ADR-0020 — Project Storage Is Six Packages Over Ports, With A Protocol That Needs No Atomic Rename

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Phase 02 is built as six packages, each with one responsibility, layered so that nothing above the browser adapters reaches a browser API.
  - `packages/project-format` holds the authoritative, versioned project: the aggregate `ProjectState` (the domain `Project` of `ADR-0015`, each asset's media source and its import provenance), `ContentId`, the external source identity record, the source change policy, export provenance, canonical JSON, the runtime-validated project document, the one rule of pre-1.0 schema compatibility, the chunked content digest, the ZIP container, the portable bundle manifest and the unpacked tree. It is pure: bytes and digests reach it through ports.
  - `packages/project-commands` holds the commands that change a project, each with its inverse. The packet names this module `packages/commands/project`. A package nested inside `packages/commands` would be read as the command machinery by every per-package architecture rule, which captures the package from the first path segment, so it is a package of its own beside it.
  - `packages/history` holds the branching history as values: nodes, the cursor, the path between two nodes, branch names, named snapshots, A/B comparison with the difference of two states, and retention and compaction planning.
  - `packages/media-store` holds source media by content: the shared object store over a backend port, import by copy or by reference, the progressive fingerprint, the classification of an external source, and reachability with deterministic collection.
  - `packages/storage` holds the keeping of projects over a backend port: the storage root and its compatibility, `ProjectRepository`, `CommandJournal`, `SnapshotStore`, the project session, the `ProjectWriteLease` contract, autosave and recovery, `BackupPolicy` and generations, usage by category, cleanup priority and purge, forks, and the export and import of bundles and unpacked trees.
  - `packages/browser-storage` implements the ports in the browser: the origin-private file system through a dedicated worker with synchronous access handles, Web Locks and a broadcast channel for the write lease, IndexedDB for kept file handles, and the file and directory pickers. It receives the platform objects from new files of `packages/capabilities`, the one package that reads the browser's globals.
- **Persistence protocol:** no rename and no atomic replace is assumed, because Safari at the floor (16.4) offers the origin-private file system only through synchronous access handles, which write in place. Every file except the two heads is written once, under a name no other content takes, and carries a checksum, so a torn write fails its check and is never read as data. A project's commit point is one of two head files, each with a generation number and a checksum; the valid head with the higher generation is current, and the next checkpoint writes the other. Between checkpoints, every change is a journal record numbered in sequence; recovery replays records after the head's position and stops at the first record that is missing or fails its check, keeping the rest aside and reporting it. The write lease is fenced by an epoch: an owner that takes a project raises the epoch and seals the old one at its last record, and records of an older epoch after the seal are ignored.
- **Content identity:** a `ContentId` is the SHA-256 of the byte length and of the SHA-256 of each 1 MiB chunk. A file is hashed as it streams, in the platform's native digest through an injected port, and never whole in memory; the fixed chunk size is part of the format.
- **Drivers:** `REQ-STOR-101` requires a command journal with periodic immutable snapshots and recovery from a torn tail; `REQ-STOR-098` requires one writer per project in a storage context, with transfer and a safe failure where coordination is absent; `REQ-STOR-099` requires cryptographic content identity; `REQ-EXEC-136.4` and the packet keep the project domain off the origin-private file system and the File System Access API; `REQ-EXEC-216` forbids assuming a file fits in memory; `CLAUDE.md` G1 requires one responsibility per module and I/O through injected ports.
- **Constraints:** only `packages/browser-storage` and the application touch a browser storage API. The five other packages compile without the DOM library and are framework-free under the architecture rules. Nothing in them persists the domain's in-memory values directly: the document is converted field by field and validated when read (`REQ-EXEC-136.12`). Before 1.0 a stored document of another schema version is refused and reported, never migrated (`REQ-STOR-052`).
- **Change record:** affected requirements are the Phase 02 owned set; affected phase 02 only; the packet's owned module `packages/commands/project` is realised as `packages/project-commands`, and `packages/browser-storage` is added beneath the ports; compatibility impact none, because nothing is yet persisted in these formats; already-passed phase remediation none; verification by the architecture rules, which name each package, and the packages' own suites.
- **Related requirements:** `REQ-STOR-021`, `REQ-STOR-025`, `REQ-STOR-026`, `REQ-STOR-052`, `REQ-STOR-098` through `REQ-STOR-106`, `REQ-STOR-193` through `REQ-STOR-200`, `REQ-EXEC-136`, `REQ-EXEC-184`.
